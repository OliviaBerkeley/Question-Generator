            Ok, so you know how interacting with other people can be really
            awkward? Sometimes you want to say something infinitely interesting
            and witty, but your brain is just like, "No, just stare at them like
            your a fish looking out of a fishbowl. That'll surely impress them!"
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's the fix! And it's totally feasible â€” you just have to always
            have either your laptop or your phone on you at all times with this
            page pulled up! Which isn't weird at all!
          </p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Find a question...</h4>
            <h5 id="question">Press the button!</h5>
          </div>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-dark">New Question</button>
      </div>
